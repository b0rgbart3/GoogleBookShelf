Rowling's work from a broad range of perspectives within literature, folklore, psychology, sociology, and popular culture. A significant portion of the book explores the Harry Potter series' literary ancestors, including magic and fantasy works by Ursula K. LeGuin, Monica Furlong, Jill Murphy, and others, as well as previous works about the British boarding school experience. Other chapters explore the moral and ethical dimensions of Harry's world, including objections to the series raised within some religious circles. In her new epilogue, Lana A. Whited brings this volume up to date by covering Rowling's latest book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0826215491"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780826215499"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":418,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":13,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.0.5.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iO5pApw2JycC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iO5pApw2JycC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA329&dq=Harry&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&dq=Harry&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ivory_Tower_and_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=iO5pApw2JycC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Ivory_Tower_and_Harry_Potter-sample-epub.acsm?id=iO5pApw2JycC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iO5pApw2JycC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"<b>Harry</b>.

Daniel"],"publisher":"University of Texas Press","publishedDate":"2009-12-03","description":"Harry Reasoner was one of the most trusted and well-liked journalists of the golden age of network television news. Whether anchoring the evening newscast on CBS in the 1960s or on ABC in the 1970s, providing in-depth reporting on 60 Minutes, or hosting numerous special programs covering civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and Watergate, Reasoner had \"that almost mystical quality it seems to take for good television reporting, exuding this atmosphere of truth and believability,\" in the words of Walter Cronkite. Yet his reassuring manner and urbane, often witty, on-air persona masked a man who was far more complex and contradictory. Though gifted with the intelligence and drive to rise to the top of his profession, Reasoner was regarded by many colleagues as lazy and self-indulgent, a man who never achieved his full potential despite his many accomplishments. Harry Reasoner: A Life in the News covers the entire sweep of this enigmatic journalist's life and career. Douglass K. Daniel opens with Reasoner's Depression-era Midwestern upbringing and follows him through his early work in newspapers and radio before he joined CBS in 1956. Focusing on Reasoner's thirty-five-year tenure in television news, Daniel presents fascinating, behind-the-scenes accounts of Reasoner's key role in founding the top-rated newsmagazine 60 Minutes. He also explores Reasoner's highly publicized move to ABC in 1970, where he anchored the nightly newscast, first with Howard K. Smith and later with Barbara Walters—a disastrous pairing from which Reasoner's career never fully recovered. Based on scores of interviews and unpublished letters, memos, and other primary sources, this first biography of the man once rated second in credibility only to Walter Cronkite illuminates an entire era in broadcast journalism, as well as many of the unique personalities, from Andy Rooney to Mike Wallace, who made that era distinctive.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0292782365"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780292782365"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":292,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC&pg=PA1&dq=Harry&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":30,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":16.5,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC&rdid=book-jGbyuBwKrDMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":30000000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":16500000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In a 1981 memoir <b>Harry</b> Reasoner chose to reveal few memories of a childhood <br>\nspent in five different communities in two Midwestern states.

The twists and turns of the series, as well as the psychological depth and complexity of J. K. Rowling’s characters, have kept fans enthralled with and puzzling over the many mysteries that permeate Hogwarts and beyond: Do the Harry Potter books encourage disobedience? Why is everyone so fascinated by Professor Lupin? What exactly will Harry and his friends do when they finally pass those N.E.W.T.s? Do even wizards live by the ticking of the clock?

In his 29 years he has served on the frontline in Afghanistan and taken lives there, he has set up his own charities, undertaken his first solo tour representing his grandmother The Queen, has been a figure of controversy, and has won a humanitarian award. Equally at home in military uniform, black tie or jeans and baseball cap, Prince Harry certainly grabs life with both hands and rides it at 100 miles an hour.Harry: A Biography sets out to document the full, true story behind the popular prince as he steps out of the shadow of his older brother Prince William. Covering his early years, the breakdown of his parents' marriage, the death of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, his relationship with his father and Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall, his time at Sandhurst and serving in Afghanistan, his charity walk to the North Pole, the women in his life, his partying, and his first solo tour. Comprehensive yet entirely accessible, Harry: A Biography paints a revelatory portrait of the 'coolest' member of the royal family.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1782430377"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781782430377"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eQnwMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eQnwMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eQnwMgEACAAJ&dq=Harry&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eQnwMgEACAAJ&dq=Harry&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Harry.html?hl=&id=eQnwMgEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eQnwMgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Harry: A Biography sets out to document the full, true story behind the popular prince as he steps out of the shadow of his older brother Prince William."}}]
